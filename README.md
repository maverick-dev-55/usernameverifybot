# Discord Username verification
Simple discord bot used for verifying usernames for your game (or other service)  
already optimized to run on heroku, all you need to do is create the bots account in the developer portal (there are many tutorials like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b61kcgfOm_4)), then copy your discord bot token in a file called .env like this  
```env
PASSWORD=[token]
```
if you dont already have a heroku account go to [The signup page](https://signup.heroku.com/)  
this should take you to to [the dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), now create an app [**use this tutorial**](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps), and now to publish your app you need to push to git [this should help if you dont have git/dont know how to use it](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
